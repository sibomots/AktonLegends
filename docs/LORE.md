= INTRODUCTION

By the reckoning of the town elders, the dangers and calamaity of the ages long past are all but words in scrolls kept
shuttered in the attic of the library. Very few even know that the scrolls exist since the relics are not even discussed openly even when throats are well lubricated by the strong ale poured every night at the Grey Wolf Inn.

The town (if we can call it that, it is more like a village) is situated only a hour walk from the rocky shore of the Sea.  A maintained road connects the street of the village to the shore where on a regular basis fishermen go to venture out in the wide bay for their catch.

The village is mostly made up of farmers and some fishermen. Chief among the produce of the village is excess grain and durable foodstuffs that are preserved in well made glass jars. Another product of the village is a high quality glass which is made from a unique mineral to this area, but easily mined from the nearby mountains to the east of town.

Carts coming in from the east are usually carrying produce harvested in the farms that dot the lowlands and foothills of the mountains. Hardy grains and some root vegetables.  Nearer the mountains are few foundaries owned by well established families of the region who have been making glass artifacts – for utility and for art for generations and generations.  The families most prosperous in their trade and travel are the

Markov’s, Temple’s, Gronson’s, and Voldar’s. It’s not hard to guess what kind of work most villagers are involved with..  They either farm in some form, work in the glass founderies, or provide some essential service to the whole economy (like carrying loads, or running the Inn, or more important blacksmith guild). The structure of the town, officially, is overseen by an elected Master (every year). The Master is assisted by a 5 person council who are appointed every two years.


Together with the Master, the council and a sixth sense of political winds in the village, rules and bylaws are both made and enforced. In the main, the town is all together peaceful, and rarely does any resident catch the harsh punishment due for egregious violation. It is not universally agreed that everthing is fair to the majority, there’s some occaisional rumblings of corruption or nepotism, but by and large people seem to go along in order to get along

As far as the lay of the land – The road is used to carry fresh fish to town, and to deliver products to the single pier at the warf from town. The road continues through town to the east towards the foothills of the mountain range where along the path live the most prosperous families who deal with the largest farms and the oldest foundaries.  In town there are few apartments and a store. There’s also the Inn which doubles as a watering hole for the town. In the upper floor are a few guest rooms that cater to travellers who arrive by ship or by foot along trails on the coast.


The warf itself by the Sea has one could describe a very tiny sister village, but only for the purpose of services specific to the fishermen and trade at the pier. There’s an official customs office (an extension of the Master), and a single story wooden house that runs a small Tavern.

The trail along the coast snakes along the high ground just on the edge of the shore both to the north and south. It is not a path that is frequently walked, even by the villagers.  They tend to stay close.

But as time passes, strangers have been known to find themselves suddenly in the view of surprised fishermen and agents at the warf as they come off the trail.

The elders of the village have passed along their knowledge of the dangers that are long past to this population. The times best forgotten were of the horrors that were unleashed when unnatural creatures were said to have lurked in the dark caverns and mines in the mountains. The minerals used to forge glass seem to come from a limitless supply of resources, and the four families who control the largest share of these resources are just as mysterious.




= LORE

The world of Akton is defined by a history of an ancient people who come to the shores an age before.

They were the Crystal Gnomes,. They came by ships. It was only by mishap and circumstance the vessels found the relatively safe harbor just west of what is now the town of Akton.

Legends say there was a terrible storm that overwhelmed the ships and in the maelstrom, the ships accidentally (but to their relief), found the protection of the harbor as it were.


The travellers (the Crystal Gnomes) were suitably prepared for sea travel but to make provision of survival on land was not planned – at least not planned enough for the abrupt and destructive storm that wrecked them on the shore. They were on a journey only they knew, that history was forgotten and lost. Some eldars in modern times still cling to some very ancient writings that purport that the leaders of the Crystal Gnomes were always intending to reach this shore – that theory believed for the intense and magical properties of the crystals that were mined from the mountains nearby. It seemed too neat a conincidence.

Other studied sages in modern times disagree on points of detail, but none can really discount the similarities between the legendary skills of the Crystal Gnomes and the powers they were believed to have when the Ice Crystals and their qualities are examined closely

Nonetheless, the chapter of the story that involves the motivations of the Crystal Gnomes is unwritten. For the time being, the lore and fascination is focused on what the Crystal Gnomes did once they were saved by the fortunate landing, albeit an event that placed them in a time and space that was final for their race.


== THE STORY OF AKTON

The legend goes that the Crystal Gnomes washed ashore from a single remaining ship. The other two ships in their group were overwhelmed by the seas and were capsized and buried at the bottom of the Trundle Sea. The last remaning ship which was called The Light ran up against the rock bar just on the edge of the harbor. The deep water between their landing to the shore was not far, and the survivors floated and swam the distance barely making landfall before the elements would have taken their lives. Swells and crashing waves washed ashore a small number of crates they carried with them, but for the most part what they had was what they carried in their own cloaks.


The parties that survived the storm were three families of the
Crystal Gnomes, in total only twelve souls.

=== Markove

The family of Markove¨ led by their patriarch Arnaldur, with his three children.

* Gregor, the eldest son, approximately the age of 20-30 years.
* Helgi, the daughter, thought to be quite young but still of the age of weilding powers and strong.
* Torvald, the youngest of the children in Arnaldur’s surving family and thought to be a mere 10-12 years of age.
*  His wife Jo/’runn drowned in the accident. Her body was retreived and buried in a grave site that is believed to be in the Old Forest.


=== Gronssen

The next family represented among the Survivors was a couple and their only child that bear the family name Gronssen ¨ .

* The matriarch of the family was a strong woman of some nobility in their society, who had the name Ingiríður.
* Their children, whose names were are not known did not survive. It is believed they had four children, two
males and two females. By the relative age of the parents, the children are thought to have been of adult age at the time of the disaster.

=== Valborg

The last family known to be represented by the survivors was a a group of siblings. There were six siblings. Three sons and three daughters. They share the family name Valborg.

The daughters of the Valborg family line were each married but without children themselves. They were relatively young, about the age between 17 to 25 years old.

* The eldest of the daughters was Andría, about 25 years
old.
* The next two younger daughters Týra and Sía, believed
to be in their late teens or early twenties.
* The two eldest sons were twins. The twins were named Níls and Mímir. It is believe they were identical twins, of some mature age between 40-50 years old. They were not belived to be married, but there is also a theory that one of the six children was not in fact a sibling, but the wife a distant cousin.
* The youngest brother was the youngest of the siblings and he was named Nikolas. He was believed to be between 20 and 21 years of age.


== The Shipwreck

That morning they wrecked, after all of the survivors assembled on the shore they used their limited magical powers to conjure a protective aura and made fires for warmth.  That was the last day any of them saw their ruined ship for the storm battered the wood to shards that simply washed away.

Then on that day, the weather cleared. The females of the group took survey of their fate. The most valuable resource they owned between them were the Crystal Shards. This was the primary energy source that delivered their magic powers. The eldar of the families had prior to this their own pecquiler magic distinct from other families, but all of them relied on the power embedded within the Crystal Shards.


The qualities of the Crystal Shards to anyone not a Crystal Gnomes would be difficult to detect or even notice, but to a Crystal Gnomes, they were unique and obvious. The word that the Crystal Gnomes used to describe the Shards themselves and the power they radiated was simply known as The Light. Legend is conflicted about The Light – was it a radiated like natural light? Or was it just a aura field, invisible but felt and harnessed? No living soul in the age since this event can be certain. What is certain is that the Crystal Gnomes honored and protected their Crystal Shards as if they were venerable members of their own families.


Despite the tragic and unseemly nature of their demise on the shores of Akton (a name that was given in later years to these regions), the Crystal Gnomes were legends in terms of their magic and inteligence.


In the days that followed, the Crystal Gnomes first established refuge in the Old Forest, for it provided a safe environment from the weather and gave them protection. The Crystal Gnomes were cautious because they were unsure of there were other inhabitants in the area.

For a while then the families subsided on the game and fisheries and made a meager existance, but they had already set their sights on the mountains they saw rise in the east and south. In their native lands, it was within mountains that they had the most sense of comfort and control.


The Crystal Shards were also a concern. As long as the Crystal Gnomes remained away from the mountains, the power drained from the Shards would not be easily reinvigorated.  It was as if the mountains affected the strength of the Shards and then likewise affected the strength of the magic of the Crystal Gnomes.


So, by the first Spring, the families had left their makeshift dwellings in the Old Forest and ventured east and south to find shelter and properly establish their domain within the mountains.

It is not known for sure which families ventured to which mountains, but in the modern times, the names of the families in power in Akton offer some glimpse of the distribution. Only a few of the scholars in the modern Akton society would understand the significance, for most of the population of the village and surrounding area are indifferent to the legends and stories of the eldars, let alone the lore of the Crystal Gnomes.


As the Crystal Gnomes explored they realized that the land was not inhabited. Whatver civilization was there before was completely lost, not even ruins or descendants could be found. It was as if they were the first to arrive.

The Valborg family headed north and settled in the foothills and mountains of the North, and these are known as the North Mountains. The Valborg were somewhat disjointed.  Without a clear leader and just apparent siblings, they did not form a structure that could rival the Markove. But they ¨ had strength in numbers.


The Markove¨ family went due east and kept their search until they had found a pass within the Prism Mountains (as they are known today). The Prism Mountains were the tallest and most majestic of them all and could be seen rising proudly from the east.  The Gronssen ¨ family (as small as it was) was less powerful than the rest and through some disagreement with the other two more powerful familes, settled on going south east into what is known as the Icy Mountains. These were the closest to the Old Forest.
